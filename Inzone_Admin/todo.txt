	a) Rename and change stored procedure Interaction_SetInfoBit to:
		CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.Interaction_Subscribe
			(
				@ParticipantID				int,
				@CustomerID					int,
				@Subscribed					bit
			)
		AS
			UPDATE    Interactions
			SET              Subscribed = @Subscribed
			WHERE     (ParticipantID = @ParticipantID) AND (CustomerID = @CustomerID)
	
	This just tidys everything up a bit and makes sure that all code is
	correct.
